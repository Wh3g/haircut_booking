## Tech stack

This project is being built using the following technologies:

- Java
- Spring Boot
- Maven
- JUnit
- MySQL

## Installation and Use

To install this application, simply clone this repository and open the directory in the IDE of your choice (I've used VS Code personally, but Eclipse will work as well).

Before running the application, it is important you have a running local MySQL server, if you don't you will get an error message similar to this one:

```Text
com.mysql.cj.jdbc.exceptions.CommunicationsException: Communications link failure
```

To use a MySQL database on your machine, you will need a local server environment such as MAMP, though there are alternatives. Then set the MySQL port to `3306` and start the server. Finally you can run the Spring Boot application, in VS Code, you can do this by right-clicking the file `haircut-booking/src/main/java/com/wh/haircutbooking/HaircutBookingApplication.java` and selecting the option `Run Java`, whichever IDE you use, it is important you run the programme from this file because this is the file with the `main` method.
